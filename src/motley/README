Motley is my attempt at a cscope-like program. The output should be
readable by cscope if -c is specified.

The basic concept is to strip out as much code as possible: what is
left should be the symbols we want. Motley is more or less stateless
and doesn't really know how to parse C.

Motley can only give definitions, it cannot find all the functions
that call a function for example. This greatly reduces the parsing and
the size of the output at a loss of functionality.

It also does not keep any information about functions other than the
function name. It cannot show args or return values.

So, really, Motley is more like ctags than cscope. But I have a nicer
cscope interface in Emacs than tags ;)

So why write motley? I am finding that cscope struggles with newer C
code. I am just getting too many false, or missing, results.

WARNING: Motley should be considered extremely experimental. In
particular, the native output format may change as I try different
ideas.
