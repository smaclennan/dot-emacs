;; VIEW-KILL
;; Displays the entire kill ring as a single page menu of numbered items.
;; To run use:
;; M-x view-kill

;; Select a number to insert that item into your current buffer.
;; Use <SPACE> to scroll.
;; The length of your kill ring is controlled by the variable `kill-ring-max';
;; Any input other than a recongized item number will simply exit the menu

;; To install: save this file in your elisp directory
;; Add to your .emacs file:
;;  (load "view-kill")
;; OR, it's short enough, just copy the whole function into your .emacs file
