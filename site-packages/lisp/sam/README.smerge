			      Introduction

I am a huge fan of ediff. Once you are used to markups of changes within
the lines, it is hard to go back to other diff/merge tools. But while
ediff is great for buffers, files, single directories, and 3 way merges,
it falls down on large directory structures with small changes all over
the place. You spend too much time descending into directories with no
changes.

So I wrote smerge. Smerge handles finding all the changes between two
directories. It then uses ediff to do the real work.

It looks ugly, has many rough edges, and is missing quite a bit in the
configuration and documentation department, but it is usable. I use
smerge almost daily at work.


			      Requirements

* XEmacs or GNU Emacs
* ediff package
* GNU diff
* For GNU Emacs you must have my extent.el
* And of course, smerge.el!


			      How it Works

You give smerge two directories to start with. It then calls `diff -r
--brief' on the two directories. The output is post-processed into three
columns: only in directory 1, in both but different, only in directory
2.

In the left and right columns, you can copy the file to the other
directory. In the middle column, mouse 1 and mouse 2 call ediff on the
two files. mouse 3 opens a menu that lets you copy the file to the other
directory.
