* Installation

** Prerequisites
You must use GNU Make with this standalone distribution.

** Edit Makefile.inc
This file is located at the top of the distribution. Look at the various
settings and adjust them as you see fit.

** Build the library
Type `make' to do that. This step is optional if you plan on installing in one
of the ways described below (it will be performed implicitely).

** Install the library
There are two ways to install the library automatically.

1. Standard installation for GNU Emacs is done via `make install'.
2. Package style installation for XEmacs is done via `make install-pkg'.

Note that you can also perform an XEmacs package-style installation with GNU
Emacs (nothing to do with ELPA), but this will not work out of the box. You
will need some tweaks in your init file (see this blog for more information:
http://www.didierverna.net/blog/index.php?post/2013/05/14/Emacs-session-bootstrap-tweaks).

** Uninstalling the library
Depending on the installation type, you can uninstall with either `make
uninstall' or `make uninstall-pkg'.

** Additional documentation formats
If the library provides some documentation, it is built as Info files by
default. You can however build it in other formats by typing `make FORMAT' in
the doc/ subdirectory, FORMAT being one of `dvi', `ps', `pdf', `html'. The
HTML version is built in its own .html subdirectory of doc/.

Note that only the Info documentation is automatically installed.


	Have fun!
