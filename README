This directory tree contains my config files and packages for XEmacs,
SXEmacs, and GNU Emacs.

A brief rundown:

* The config files are in the top level.

* The esp directory contains the "Emacs Special Packages". These are
  files needed only for GNU Emacs. They are in a non-standard place so
  that XEmacs will not automagically pick them up.

* The site-packages directory is laid out as per XEmacs. It should be
  automagically used. There is code in init.el to handle the GNU Emacs
  case.

Running an old emacs?

If you are running an old emacs that does not support the .emacs.d
directory, create the following one line .emacs file:

(load "~/.emacs.d/init")
