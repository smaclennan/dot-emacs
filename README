This directory tree contains my config files and packages for XEmacs,
SXEmacs, and GNU Emacs.

A brief rundown:

* The config files are in the top level.

* The site-packages directory is laid out as per XEmacs. It should be
  automagically used. There is code in init.el to handle the GNU Emacs
  case.

* The esp directory contains the "Emacs Special Packages". These are
  files needed only for GNU Emacs. They are in a non-standard place so
  that XEmacs will not automagically pick them up.

* There is a site-packages/lisp/xemacs directory for XEmacs specific
  files not used by GNU Emacs.

* I use Didier Verna's el-rcfiles package. The rc files are in the rc
  directory. https://github.com/didierverna/el-rcfiles

Optional config files called from init.el:

* user-init.el: If user-init.el exists, it is run at the start of
  init.el. If it provides the function `user-init-fini' it is called
  at the end of init.el. This is used to tweak per machine settings
  such as email address and laptop-mode.

* work.el: This provides work related configs. This is very specific
  to my job, you probably want to override it.

* mail-<domain name>.el: This is called from the sendmail rc file if
  it exists.

* windoze.el: Called if you are running windoze... Nuff said.
