This directory tree contains my config files and packages for XEmacs,
SXEmacs, and GNU Emacs.

A brief rundown:

* The config files are in the top level.

* My lisp code is in lisp.

* Other lisp code is in misc.

* Emacs specific code is in emacs.

* XEmacs specific code is in xemacs.

* I use Didier Verna's el-rcfiles package. The rc files are in the rc
  directory. https://github.com/didierverna/el-rcfiles

Optional config files called from init.el:

* user-init.el: If user-init.el exists, it is run at the start of
  init.el. This is used to tweak per machine settings such as email
  address and laptop-mode.

* work.el: This provides work related configs. This is very specific
  to my job, you probably want to override it.

* mail-<domain name>.el: This is called from the sendmail rc file if
  it exists.
