ESP - Emacs Specific Package

This directory contains files for compatibility between Emacs and
XEmacs. DO NOT use these under XEmacs.

* build-loaddefs.el: I couldn't find a way to automagically build the
		     loaddefs files. So here is a simple version.

* esp.el: bootstrap the ESP code and general compatibility

* extent.el: Simple XEmacs extent compatibility for Emacs.

* itimer.el: Simple XEmacs itimer compatibility for Emacs.


These are just XEmacs files that Emacs is missing:

* igrep.el
* rcfiles.el
